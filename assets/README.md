# kennys-wonderous-portfolio

## Description

- I made this webpage to learn more about HTML and CSS, to practice muscle memory of codes. As well as to get an idea for how to create a work porfolio.
- I built this project to make finding my contact information easier and to learn how to set up a webpage
- It solves the problem of looking for my good work (when i make more projects) and for my information to be easily found
- I learned semantic HTML, CSS formating, how to use a container, different stying techniques, positioning and sizing and much more.

## Usage

At the top of my page there are buttons to the right, they are only for show but the background color changes when you hover over it

These are the sections that the buttons should lead to

These are the links you can click on to see more about me or get in contact with me

Samuel Wlodawski was a great help at explaining some of the CSS functions and where they worked on the webpage
