    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>My name is Kenneth Hasson! Im 19 years old, about to turn 20 in June and I graduated from Northeast Metro Tech High School with my major in Engineering and Architecture. Although I've been struggling with some of the coding in this class, I've had a lot of fun as well learning something new and have great support from my lovely girlfriend!
